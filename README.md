# Plant Disease Classification Model

## Overview
This project leverages a deep learning approach to classify plant diseases using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained on the [New Plant Diseases Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset) from Kaggle. The model is capable of identifying 38 different classes of plant diseases, helping farmers and agricultural experts take timely action to protect crops.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of thousands of labeled images of diseased and healthy plant leaves across various plant species. It is organized into training and validation sets, ensuring robust model performance.

## Model Architecture
The CNN model was built using TensorFlow and Keras. It includes multiple convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, and dense layers to effectively learn and classify the complex features of plant diseases.

## Setup and Installation
